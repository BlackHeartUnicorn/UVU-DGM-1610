  storyText: "\"WAKE UP GREENIES!\" My eyes fly open as I stumble out of my cot. Where
    am I? \n\"To the parade ground you worthless Cons!\" My tent mate groans as he
    rolls off his cot. \"Why did I let myself get conscripted into the army?\" he
    grumbles to himself as he stumbles out of the tent.\nOh yeah, I got conscripted
    into the army. Now I wake up at some early hour each day to march stupid drills
    and get yelled at all the time. Do I really have to go today? Maybe I could just
    sleep...\n\n1: Go to the parade ground\n2: Go back to sleep"
