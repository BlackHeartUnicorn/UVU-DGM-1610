  storyText: "I hear yelling and the clamor of battle. I've already seen other squads
    charge over the hill into battle. Soon it will be my squad's turn. I grip my sword
    a bit tighter. Am I ready for this? \r\nAs I ponder my heart freezes when I hear
    screams from the other side of the hill. It sounds like the last squad didn't
    do too well. \r\n\r\nWhat do I do?\r\n1. Try to sneak away from the battle\r\n2.
    Check my equipment to make sure I'm ready to fight"
